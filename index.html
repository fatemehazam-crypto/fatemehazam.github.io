  <h2>In-Progress Work: Rust-Based Secure Commander Middleware for Drone Fleets</h2>
  <p class="tagline">
    Building a high-performance Rust security gateway that prevents command-injection and hijacking attacks in autonomous drone fleets.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Overview</strong></summary>
    <p>
      In modern smart-city operations, drones manage real-time traffic monitoring, inspections, and emergency response. 
      However, these systems are vulnerable: attackers can inject malicious flight commands through radio links, causing 
      route deviations, stalling missions, or forcing unsafe maneuvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Existing drone control frameworks—such as Python’s <code>cflib</code> used for Crazyflie drones—often lack rigorous,
      real-time command validation. This project introduces a Rust-based security middleware designed to eliminate that gap.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>The Solution</strong></summary>
    <p>
      I am architecting and developing a secure command-validation middleware that acts as a mandatory gateway between 
      ground-control applications and physical drones. The middleware validates every command before it ever reaches the aircraft,
      ensuring authenticity, integrity, and mission-level safety.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Technical Approach & Architecture</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>Security as a Sidecar</h4>
    <p>
      The middleware is implemented as a standalone Rust service (“sidecar”) that intercepts all outbound flight commands. 
      This allows seamless integration with existing Python-based controllers (<code>cflib</code>) without requiring 
      major code changes.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi-Layer Command Validation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>CRC and packet-integrity verification</li>
      <li>Commander ID and source-authorization checks</li>
      <li>Cryptographic signatures ensuring command authenticity</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Attack Mitigation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time rate limiting to prevent command flooding</li>
      <li>Rules engine to detect suspicious patterns and unauthorized waypoint changes</li>
      <li>Trajectory-aware anomaly detection for off-path maneuvers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why Rust?</h4>
    <p>
      Rust is used to guarantee memory safety, eliminate buffer-overflow vulnerabilities, and provide fearless concurrency 
      for managing multiple drone connections in parallel. The middleware is designed for high reliability, predictable latency, 
      and safe integration with real-time flight operations.

  <h2>Micro Aerial Vehicle Hijacking & Autonomous Flight Security Analysis</h2>

  <!-- Short Overview -->
  <p class="project-summary">
    A research-driven project demonstrating real-time drone trajectory planning, 
    battery-aware autonomous flight, and an application-layer hijacking attack
    on the Crazyflie 2.1 micro-UAV. I created modified flight controllers that 
    allow an attacker radio to override the legitimate commander mid-flight, 
    redirecting the drone to spoofed GPS coordinates while anomaly-detection 
    algorithms flag deviations from the expected trajectory.

    <summary><strong>Game Design & Implementation</strong></summary>
    <p>
      The game is built in Godot and designed for both arcade cabinet deployment and standard desktop browsers. 
      It scales difficulty based on the player's accuracy and reaction time while introducing increasingly sophisticated 
      phishing patterns, domain spoofing cues, and timing pressure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Godot 4.x engine</li>
      <li>Dynamic difficulty adjustment</li>
      <li>Phishing pattern generation system</li>
      <li>Both desktop and HTML5 export supported</li>

    <summary><strong>Real-Time Analytics Architecture</strong></summary>
    <p>
      The HTML5-exported Godot build communicates directly with a backend analytics service running on an Ubuntu server. 
      All gameplay events—choices, mistakes, response times, difficulty transitions, session data—are logged in real time 
      and can be inspected through a dashboard.
    </p>

    <h4>📡 Client-to-Server Event Streaming</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Godot Web export uses JavaScript bridge for HTTP requests</li>
      <li>Events POSTed to Express API</li>
      <li>Stored in MongoDB for aggregation, dashboards, and long-term studies</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>🖥 Server Stack</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js v24.9.0</li>
      <li>Express.js API server</li>
      <li>MongoDB with indexed event collections</li>
      <li>Ubuntu cloud server (self-hosted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>📊 Analytics Dashboard</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Web-based dashboard built using vanilla HTML, JS, and REST</li>
      <li>Tracks accuracy, response time, phishing detection type, level progression</li>
      <li>Realtime charts for educators & researchers</li>
      <li>Supports classroom monitoring and long-term analytics</li>
    </ul>
